    <h1>Main Heading</h1>


    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is
        a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
        coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of
        sentences or a single <span> sentence </span> that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and
        appearance do not
        determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
        journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group
        of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
        because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

    <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide
        on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are
        trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words,
        your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the
        information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas,
        will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where
        there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</p>


    <p>
        From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process
        for building a paragraph that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and
        example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.

    <ul id="abc">
        <li>item 1</li>
        <li>item 2</li>
        <li>item 3</li>
    </ul>



    <script>

        // let els1 = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

        // let els2 = document.querySelectorAll("p");

        // console.log(els1);
        // console.log(els2);

        let els3 = document.querySelectorAll("abc");
        console.log(els3)
